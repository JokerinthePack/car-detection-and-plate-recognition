# car-detection-and-plate-recognition

The purpose of this study is to make inferences about approaching vehicles for making
riders much more aware of rear traffic. By the designed system that makes these
inferences, a much more secure traveling experience would be provided for all riders
and drivers. These inferences are distance and size informations of an approaching
vehicle. In the light of these informations, warning the rider by visual and auditory
components (lights, rear camera and buzzers) is the key aim of this designed system.
Also to be able to perform necessary procedures regarding drivers who neglect the
laws of traffic and the need of traveling at a secure distance, a process to take photos
of their vehicle is also designed. This process enables the system to take photos and
read license plates for future usage by a variety of image processing operations.
